==========

Meaning Bot is a Twitter bot that synthesizes aphorisms about life's meaning. Follow it at [@meaningbot](https://twitter.com/meaningbot).

### Description

MeaningBot looks for tweets about the meaning (and point, and purposeâ€¦) of life, and combines pairs of them into aphorisms, which it then tweets. For example, it might combine these two tweets:

> The purpose of life is trying your hardest.

> Eating a meatball sub in the bathtub is the meaning of life.

into

> Eating a meatball sub in the bathtub is trying your hardest.

Care is taken to exclude words and phrases that result in boring content, and on each pass, we reference our past tweets in a effort not to be repetitive.

This bot uses  [Chatterbot](https://github.com/muffinista/chatterbot), which is build on the [Twitter gem](https://github.com/sferik/twitter).

### Usage

The code for this bot lives in `bin/meaning_bot.rb`, which contains the `MeaningBot` module, and also executes the `run` method defined therein. The bot can therefore be run both from the command line and from irb.

E.g. from the command line, you can run

> `ruby bin/meaning_bot.rb 1 test`

which forces the script to build a tweet but runs the bot in test mode, outputting the tweet text instead of actually tweeting). Alternatively, 

> `ruby bin/meaning_bot.rb 6`

would run in production mode, tweeting every 6th time on average. The reason to have the ability to throttle the tweet frequency is that in production the bot uses [Heroku Scheduler](https://addons.heroku.com/scheduler), which is used to call execute the script every 10 minutes, but we don't want to tweet that frequently or regularly.

To run the same two commands in irb, we would use the following:

> `MeaningBot.run(:frequency => 1, :testing => true)`

> `MeaningBot.run(:frequency => 6)`
